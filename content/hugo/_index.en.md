We'll explore [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) with [blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown) and compare it to [hugodown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/).

Note that Hugo changes fast. Exciting (more features!) and scary (broken websites). Thankfully both blogdown and hugodown pin a Hugo version to each website project.

The blogdown package is a feature-complete package with currently outdated docs. The hugodown package is minimal and experimental.
